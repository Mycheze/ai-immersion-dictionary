Generate a dictionary entry in JSON format where:  
- Definitions are ALWAYS in [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE]  
- Examples are ALWAYS in [TARGET_LANGUAGE]  
- Translations (if needed) are in [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE]  
- Multi-word expressions are preserved exactly as provided

### **JSON Structure (MUST MATCH EXACTLY)**  
```json
{
    "metadata": {
        "source_language": "[SOURCE_LANGUAGE]",
        "target_language": "[TARGET_LANGUAGE]",
        "definition_language": "[DEFINITION_LANGUAGE]"
    },
    "headword": str,  // PRESERVE AS-IS including all words
    "part_of_speech": str|list,
    "meanings": [{
        "definition": str,  // ALWAYS in [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE]
        "grammar": {
            "noun_type": str|null,  // e.g., "masculine", "feminine"
            "verb_type": str|null,  // e.g., "transitive", "irregular"
            "comparison": str|null  // e.g., "comparative", "superlative"
        },
        "examples": [{
            "sentence": str,  // ALWAYS in [TARGET_LANGUAGE]
            "translation": str|null  // In [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE] if different
        }]
    }]
}

Strict Rules

    Definition Language:

        Definitions must be in [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE] (no exceptions).

        If [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE] = [TARGET_LANGUAGE], still use [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE].

    Example Sentences:

        Always in [TARGET_LANGUAGE].

        Include a translation only if [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE] ≠ [TARGET_LANGUAGE].

    Grammar Notes:

        Only include if relevant (e.g., noun gender, verb conjugation).

        Keep terminology simple (e.g., "feminine noun," not "noun of feminine grammatical gender").

    Content Style:

        Definitions: Short, clear, and natural (e.g., "a musical instrument with strings" not "a chordophone played with a bow").

        Examples: Everyday usage (no poetic/literary unless explicitly requested).

    Structural Integrity:

        All keys must be present (use null for empty fields).

        No extra keys, no missing keys.

Special handling for multi-word expressions:
    - Phrasal verbs (e.g., "go out with"): Maintain exact word order and particles
    - Compound nouns (e.g., "coffee table"): Preserve spacing
    - Separable verbs (e.g., "všímat si"): Keep all components

Prohibited:

❌ Definitions in the wrong language
❌ Overly complex explanations
❌ Missing/undefined JSON fields
❌ Markdown, HTML, or comments
Language Settings:

    Definition Language: [DEFINITION_LANGUAGE]
    Target Language: [TARGET_LANGUAGE]
    Source Language: [SOURCE_LANGUAGE]

Output ONLY the JSON object. The word follows:
